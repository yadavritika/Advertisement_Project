          RealEstate.com delivers the best real estate deals first, well before
          they hit the mass market. As you know, perfect timing – not just
          "location, location, location" – is critical when it comes to
          purchasing a new home and/or investment property at the right (lowest
          possible) price. That's because competition drives prices up. At
          RealEstate.com, we target low-priced distressed deals – bank-owned
          homes, government foreclosures (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, etc.)
          preforeclosure listings, real estate owned (REO) properties and
          foreclosure auctions, among others – and pass them (and huge savings)
          onto smart homebuyers (that's you!). It's so simple to find the best
          real estate deals in your area with RealEstate.com: It's one easy
          search! And that search can be performed at the state, county and city
          levels – even the exact address and/or zip code – so that your house
          hunt hits the ground running. Once you start digging into the
          incredible foreclosure deals, each listing will be complete with
          asking price, exact location, number of beds / baths, property type
          (single-family foreclosure, etc.), available photos, tax roll
          information, helpful neighborhood / school district details and so
          much more. Indeed, we provide as much information as possible so that
          you can make the most informed decision possible. RealEstate.com
          updates its nationwide database of foreclosure listings at least twice
          EACH DAY!Not weekly or monthly like other sites out there. This
          ensures that we offer prospective homebuyers and investors with the
          freshest, hottest deals on the Internet. In fact, most of our
          information comes direct from hundreds of corporate sellers and
          multiple government agencies so that you can score the deal of a
          lifetime – in some cases foreclosed homes for less than $60,000! Find
          cheap homes under $60,000. Whether your looking for a single-family
          home, condo, townhouse, or even searching for mobile homes near you,
          Foreclosure.com keeps the most up-to-date listings of all property
          types.
